This repository contains the code to run an IRT-based analysis of data from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), analyzing specifically for gender based Differential Item Functioning (DIF, essentially test bias). The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), a large-scale international assessment, is a critical tool used by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and national education agencies to inform policy decisions. The code focuses on math items, answered by participants in the United States, but can be adapted for other groups and subjects. An iterative anchor selection procedure is implemented to ensure higher reliability of  test results; the Wald Test is used for screening and the Likelihood Ratio Test for verification. The analysis conducted by the author revealed a higher rate of DIF in the 2022 cycle compared to 2018.
